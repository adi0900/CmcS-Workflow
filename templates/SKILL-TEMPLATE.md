# [Skill Name]

## Purpose
Explain in 2-3 sentences what this skill accomplishes.
Be specific about the INPUT and OUTPUT.

## When to Use This Skill
- Trigger condition 1 (e.g., "When building a landing page")
- Trigger condition 2 (e.g., "When the user asks for a CRO audit")
- Trigger condition 3

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
These are hard constraints the AI must follow:
1. [Rule 1 - e.g., "Always use mobile-first approach"]
2. [Rule 2 - e.g., "Never use more than 3 fonts"]
3. [Rule 3 - e.g., "All images must have alt text"]
4. [Rule 4 - e.g., "Maximum page load target: 2 seconds"]

## Architecture / Structure
Define the exact structure the AI should follow.
For a page skill, this is the section order.
For a component skill, this is the file structure.
For a process skill, this is the step sequence.

### [Section/Step 1]
- What it contains
- Required elements
- Constraints

### [Section/Step 2]
- What it contains
- Required elements
- Constraints

### [Section/Step 3]
- What it contains
- Required elements
- Constraints

(repeat for all sections/steps)

## Design Tokens (if visual skill)
```
Colors:
  primary: #[HEX]
  secondary: #[HEX]
  accent: #[HEX]
  background: #[HEX]
  text: #[HEX]

Typography:
  heading: [Font Name], [fallback]
  body: [Font Name], [fallback]
  scale: [e.g., 1.25 major third]

  section-gap: [e.g., 80px]
  component-gap: [e.g., 24px]
```

## Examples (Optional but powerful)
Show the AI what good output looks like:

### Good Example
[Paste a code snippet or description of correct output]

### Bad Example
[Paste what to avoid and explain why]

## Checklist (AI Self-Verification)
Before completing, the AI must verify:
- [ ] [Check 1 - e.g., "All sections present"]
- [ ] [Check 2 - e.g., "Mobile responsive tested"]
- [ ] [Check 3 - e.g., "Meta tags generated"]
- [ ] [Check 4 - e.g., "Lighthouse score > 90"]
