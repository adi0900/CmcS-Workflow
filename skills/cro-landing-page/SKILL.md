# CRO Landing Page Builder

## Purpose
Build landing pages that convert visitors into leads/customers.
INPUT: Product description, target audience, value proposition.
OUTPUT: Complete landing page with 9 CRO-optimized sections.

## When to Use This Skill
- When building a new landing page
- When redesigning an existing page for better conversions
- When a client says "I need a page that converts"

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. Mobile-first: Design for phone screens, then scale up
2. One primary CTA per viewport (no competing actions)
3. Social proof must appear before the fold ends
4. Page load target: under 2 seconds
5. Maximum 3 font weights across entire page
6. Every section must have a clear purpose (no filler)
7. CTA button text must be action-specific, not generic
   BAD: "Submit" "Click Here" "Learn More"
   GOOD: "Start Free Trial" "Get My Audit" "Book a Call"

## Architecture (9-Section Framework)

### Section 1: Hero
- Headline: 8 words max. States the transformation
- Subheadline: 1 sentence. Who it's for + outcome
- Primary CTA button
- Social proof snippet (logos, stats, or testimonial)
- Optional: Hero image/video (right side on desktop)

### Section 2: Problem
- 3 pain points the audience experiences
- Use their language, not industry jargon
- Create tension before the solution

### Section 3: Solution
- How your product/service solves the problems
- 3 benefits (not features)
- Each benefit: icon + headline + 1 sentence

### Section 4: How It Works
- 3-step process (numbered)
- Each step: number + title + description
- Makes the path to value feel simple

### Section 5: Social Proof
- Testimonials with name, role, company, photo
- Metrics/results if available
- Logos of recognizable clients

### Section 6: Features (Detail)
- Deeper feature breakdown for informed buyers
- Feature cards with icons
- Comparison table if competitors exist

### Section 7: Pricing / Offer
- Clear pricing tiers (if applicable)
- Highlight recommended tier
- What's included in each tier
- Money-back guarantee or risk reversal

### Section 8: FAQ
- 5-7 questions. Address objections, not just info
- Accordion format (expandable)
- Last FAQ should address pricing/value

### Section 9: Final CTA
- Restate the transformation
- Urgency or scarcity (if authentic)
- Same primary CTA as hero
- Secondary option (e.g., "Not ready? Join newsletter")
